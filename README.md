I had plenty of issues. Basically had an issue on every test. Had a hard time grasping exactly what I was looking at. 

Outside resources. I watched a lot on linkedin learning and on youtube about objects, arrays and conditional statments. I saved them all in a browser, but then chrome crashed becuase I had too many tabs open. As a result here are some (but not all) of the resources that I used:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp
